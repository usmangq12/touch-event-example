# Touch Event Example

**This project demonstrates handling touch events in a React application.**

It includes a draggable square that responds to touch interactions, showcasing the use of `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, and `onTouchEnd` events. The project is styled using basic CSS to center the draggable element on the screen.

## Getting Started

**Visit the Deployed Application**:
   - Open your web browser and go to [Deployed Application Link](https://touch-event-example.vercel.app).

You can now interact with the draggable square by touching and dragging it around the screen.
